# Image processing with opencv

This page aims to use OpenCV to do some simple image processing, which is the building block for this project.

OpenCV has three API wrapper: C++, [C](#C) and [Python](#Python)

To follow the tutorial on this page, you may need a USB webcam if you want to use a live feed.

## Colour tracking example

Computers do not see images the way human beings do. To a computer, an image is just a bunch of numbers. Each pixel is determiend by a set of numbers.

We will write a program that allows you to filter a picture based on a colour

Please see colour_tracking.py for code.

You can run the code by typing `python colour_tracking.py [file]`
